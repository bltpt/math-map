# math-map
A speculative graph mapping the dependencies of mathematical theorems.

## Why and How

My recollection is that the mathematical
**(axioms)**[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom] I was taught in grade
school were delivered with the message "accept these so that we can
move on." In this project, I chip away at mapping out the relationships
among those axioms and the more interesting theorems I was taught later
on.

This is essentially lay-person's attempt at implementing the same kind
of dependency relationships captured in the University of Connecticut's
(Reverse Mathematics Zoo)[https://rmzoo.math.uconn.edu/]. The code for
that project is on (GitHub)[https://github.com/ericastor/rmzoo], but as
it's aimed at people above my skill-set, I don't understand it yet!
